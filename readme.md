# JDK11-SSLSocket.getOutputStream.close-bug
A minimal working example that reproduces
```OpenJDK 11.0.1``` bug which manifests itself in ```SSLSocket.getOutputStream().close()``` not closing the socket, which contradicts [the specification of ```SSLSocket.getOutputStream``` method](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/net/Socket.html#getOutputStream()): _Closing the returned OutputStream will close the associated socket_. This example not only shows the broken behaviour but also shows a situation in which the broken behaviour causes an application to hang. The problem was reported to Oracle via https://bugreport.java.com and was accepted: https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8216326, https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=JDK-8216326.

## Running the example and reproducing the bug
### For JDK 11
Run the example with
```
java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=./keystore.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=password -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=./keystore.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=password ./SslSocketOutputStreamCloseBug.java
```
#### Sample output
```
Server (:) Starting on localhost/127.0.0.1:0
Server (:) Accepting connections on [SSL: ServerSocket[addr=localhost/127.0.0.1,localport=63197]]
Client ðŸ”Œ Connecting to localhost/127.0.0.1:63197
Server (:) Accepted a connection from /127.0.0.1:63198
Server (:) Waiting for data from the client /127.0.0.1:63198
Client ðŸ”Œ Connected via the socket Socket[addr=localhost/127.0.0.1,port=63197,localport=63198]
Client ðŸ”Œ Waiting for data from the server
Client ðŸ”Œ Closing the socket
Client ðŸ”Œ Failed to close the socket
Server (:) Received EOF
Server (:) Shut down
Client ðŸ”Œ Still waiting for data from the server...
Client ðŸ”Œ Still waiting for data from the server...
Client ðŸ”Œ Still waiting for data from the server...
...continues infinitely...
```
#### Explanation
The client (specifically ```clientSideReadingThread```) is blocked waiting for data from the server that never sends any. Then client tries to close its socket via ```SSLSocket.getOutputStream().close()``` and fails (```SSLSocket.isClosed()``` returns false). As a result the client stays infinitely blocked.

A server-side ```SSLSocket``` obtained via ```SSLServerSocket.accept()``` has the same bug, I tested this separately. ```SSLSocket.getInputStream().close()``` also does not close the associated ```SSLSocket```, and the code in the example can be trivially modified to observe this.
#### Run without TLS
One can run the example without TLS and see that ```Socket.getOutputStream().close()``` works as expected (closes the socket):
```
java ./SslSocketOutputStreamCloseBug.java noTls
```

### For JDK 10, 9, 8
Run the example with
```
javac ./SslSocketOutputStreamCloseBug.java && java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=./keystore.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=password -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=./keystore.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=password SslSocketOutputStreamCloseBug ; rm ./SslSocketOutputStreamCloseBug*.class
```
#### Sample output
```
Server (:) Starting on localhost/127.0.0.1:0
Server (:) Accepting connections on [SSL: ServerSocket[addr=localhost/127.0.0.1,localport=62884]]
Client ðŸ”Œ Connecting to localhost/127.0.0.1:62884
Server (:) Accepted a connection from /127.0.0.1:62885
Server (:) Waiting for data from the client /127.0.0.1:62885
Client ðŸ”Œ Connected via the socket b1bc7ed[TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384: Socket[addr=localhost/127.0.0.1,port=62884,localport=62885]]
Client ðŸ”Œ Waiting for data from the server
Client ðŸ”Œ Closing the socket
Server (:) Received EOF
Server (:) Shut down
Client ðŸ”Œ Stopped waiting for data from the server
Client ðŸ”Œ Closed the socket
Client ðŸ”Œ Disconnected
```

## Workaround
As a workaround in projects we can:
* Close an ```SSLSocket``` directly via ```SSLSocket.close()```.
* Use ```Socket``` :)  At least ```Socket.getOutputStream().close()``` does not have this bug.

## Comments
```keystore.jks``` was generated with ```keytool``` from OpenJDK 11:
```
keytool -keystore ./keystore.jks -storepass "password" -storetype JKS -genkeypair -dname "CN=Unknown" -alias "myKey" -keypass "password" -keyalg RSA -validity 999999
```
